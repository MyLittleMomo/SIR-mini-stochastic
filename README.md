Codes are written in matlab download if you want to open
\
The basic SIR model code can be viewed from the file "SIR.mlx" you may change the coefficients as you want, however, dt was taken as 1 day so it was not written in some parts.
\
The code for the randomly generated graphs of the SIR model can be accessed through the code "ZhondelgenSTOCHsir.mlx". If you just want to the results you may view the animation file "1111.mp4"
\
The code for the stochastic differential equation is called "WienerEulerMaruyama.mlx". You can try to change the intensity of the noise, however, I would not recommend giving values more than 0.02
